PIVOX is a decentralized milestone-based payment protocol built on Solana using the Anchor framework.
It enables transparent, secure, and trustless payments between clients and freelancers, leveraging milestone tracking, escrowed funds management, and multi-signature logic.
Additionally, the protocol supports optional Project Manager (PM) read-only access for enhanced project oversight without mutability rights.
